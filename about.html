    <h1>🇮🇳 History of the Indian National Flag</h1>

    <p>The Indian national flag, known as the <strong>Tiranga</strong> (meaning "tricolour"), symbolizes India’s unity, independence, and its struggle for freedom. Its journey began long before 1947, evolving through multiple designs shaped by the nation's revolutionary spirit.</p>

    <h2>🟠 Early Concepts (Before 1900s)</h2>
    <p>Before the idea of a unified national flag existed, India, under British rule, had no common symbol to represent its identity. Individual kingdoms had their own flags, but nothing represented India as a whole.</p>

    <h2>🟡 1906 – The First Unofficial Flag</h2>
    <p>On August 7, 1906, the first unofficial national flag was hoisted in Calcutta. It had green, yellow, and red stripes featuring lotuses, "Vande Mataram", a sun, and a crescent moon. It was a symbol of unity and resistance.</p>

    <h2>🟢 1907 – The Berlin Committee Flag</h2>
    <p>In 1907, Bhikaji Cama hoisted another version of the flag in Stuttgart, Germany. This flag was similar to the 1906 version and was displayed at an international socialist conference to raise awareness for India’s struggle.</p>

    <h2>🔵 1917 – The Home Rule Flag</h2>
    <p>During the Home Rule Movement, Annie Besant introduced a new flag. It had red and green stripes, the Union Jack, and Indian symbols like a crescent and a star. It was a step toward symbolic identity while still under British rule.</p>

    <h2>🔶 1921 – Gandhi’s Charkha Flag</h2>
    <p>Pingali Venkayya proposed a flag that Mahatma Gandhi supported. It included red (for Hindus), green (for Muslims), and a spinning wheel (charkha) symbolizing Swadeshi. Later, white was added to represent other communities and peace.</p>

    <h2>🟩 1931 – Official Tricolour Prototype</h2>
    <p>In 1931, a tricolour of saffron, white, and green with the charkha in the center was officially adopted. It represented no religious group and emphasized nationalism, courage, and unity.</p>

    <h2>🟦 1947 – Final National Flag</h2>
    <p>Just before independence, the Constituent Assembly adopted the current design on July 22, 1947. It retained the saffron, white, and green layout, but replaced the charkha with the navy blue Ashoka Chakra from the Lion Capital at Sarnath.</p>

    <h2>🇮🇳 Symbolism of the Tiranga</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Saffron:</strong> Courage and sacrifice</li>
      <li><strong>White:</strong> Truth, peace, and honesty</li>
      <li><strong>Green:</strong> Growth, faith, and prosperity</li>
      <li><strong>Ashoka Chakra:</strong> Law, dharma, and progress (24-spoke wheel)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📜 The Flag Code of India</h2>
    <p>India’s flag usage is governed by the Flag Code of India (2002), ensuring respectful display by citizens, institutions, and the government. Since 2002, all citizens can hoist the flag any day with proper respect.</p>

    <h2>🏁 Final Words</h2>
    <p>The Indian national flag is not just a design — it’s a living memory of India’s fight, identity, and unity. It waves high as a tribute to all those who gave their lives for the country’s freedom and to those who uphold its values today.</p>
